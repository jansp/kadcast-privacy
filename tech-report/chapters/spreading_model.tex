\section{Spreading Model\label{spreading_model}}
As stated in Section~\ref{introduction}, we want to analyze the privacy
properties of the Kadcast broadcasting algorithm. \\
In Kadcast, broadcast messages propagate similar to Kademlia lookup queries
[]. \\
Kadcast uses the XOR metric on a pair of node IDs to compute the distance
between those nodes. E.g. the distance between the node with ID $x$ and
the node with ID $y$ is
$$d(x, y) = x \oplus y$$
Each node has so called ``buckets'' to store ID to IP mappings of peers.
Buckets are segregated into nodes with IDs of same-length bitwise matching
prefixes.
Each bucket stores $k$ nodes. \\
This node segregation allows for efficient message passing.
When broadcasting a message, Kadcast... [TODO infografik einf√ºgen

We hypothesize that this kind of structured message propagation could
have negative effects on the privacy of the network, since the reduced
redundancy also means reduced ambiguity and could mean a better
identification of broadcast initators. Further, a structured, less
random broadcast intuitively allows for...

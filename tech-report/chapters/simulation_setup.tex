\subsection{Simulation Setup}
For our simulation we used the discrete event simulation framework ``simpy''.

- we start with setup phase and wait for all bootstrapping processes to finish and the network to stabilize
- only then we start broadcasting

- discrete event simulation, simpy
- no dropped messages/churn -> beta set to 1
- no fec

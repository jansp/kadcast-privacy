\section{Simulation Setup\label{simulation_setup}}
For our simulation we used the discrete event simulation framework
``simpy'' [ref]. \\
Our setup does not incorporate network failures or change of any kind,
especially there are no dropped and corrupted messages or failing nodes. \\
We run the simulation in two steps, starting with a setup phase, which
lets the nodes discover the network and fill their respective buckets.
After the network is stabilized we run the broadcast simulation phase. \\
Because we do not have any dropped messages, we set the redundancy
parameter $\beta$ 
to 1, as it will always suffice to saturate the network. \\
We use random latencies from the iplane latency dataset[ref iplane] for
all connections. \\
Overall, our network setup is extremely simple and it would increase the
validity of our results if we would repeat our experiments on a more
sophisticated setup.

\section{Simulation Setup}
For our simulation we used the discrete event simulation framework ``simpy''. \\
In our setup we do not incorporate network failures or change of any kind,
especially we do not have any dropped and corrupted messages or failing nodes. \\
%dropped and corrupted messages, network change, or byzantine nodes. \\
We run the simulation in two steps, starting with a setup phase, which
lets the nodes discover the network and fill their respective buckets and
after the network is stabilized we run the broadcast simulation phase. \\
Because we do not have any dropped messages, we set the redundancy parameter ``beta''
to 1, as it will always suffice to saturate the network. \\
We use latencies drawn at random from the iplane latency dataset[ref iplane] for all connections.




%- we start with setup phase and wait for all bootstrapping processes to finish and the network to stabilize
%- only then we start broadcasting

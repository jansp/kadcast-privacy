\section{Abstract}
When talking about privacy issues of blockchains or Distributed Ledger Technologies, the
focus of the analysis is often on the consensus and application layers of the blockchain.
Another major factor for a comprehensive analysis of the privacy of blockchains is
the network layer or network overlay which defines how messages are passed between participants of the network.
On this layer many privacy sensitive informations like the IP addresses of users and the connections between the peers
of the network is used and can potentially be leaked or recorded by malicious parties.
In this report we will do a privacy analysis of the newly developed, Kademlia based,
P2P overlay Kadcast that can be used for efficient message passing e.g. in Bitcoin or other blockchain based technologies.

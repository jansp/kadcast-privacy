\section{Abstract}
When discussing the privacy of blockchains or Distributed Ledger Technologies, the
focus of the analysis is often on the consensus layer of the blockchain.
Another major factor for a comprehensive privacy analysis is
the network layer, which defines how messages are passed between peers.
On this layer many privacy sensitive informations like public IP addresses of users and connections between the peers
of the network are used and can potentially be recorded by malicious parties.
In this report we will do a simulation based, quantitative privacy analysis of the Kademlia inspired
network overlay Kadcast, that can be used for efficient broadcasting e.g. in Bitcoin or other blockchain based technologies.
The focus of the anaylsis is the usage of Kadcast for broadcasting transactions and the evaluation of an adversary's capability
of linking observed transactions to IP addresses.
